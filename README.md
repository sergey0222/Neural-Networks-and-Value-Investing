Model_1

The goal of this experiment is to check whether it is possible to predict Net Income for 2018 based only on values of Net Incomes for 2011-2017.

Things to note:
- all values are scaled to space of -1...+1
- number of training examples is 1607
- loss = Mean Absolute Error

The result is as follows:

![Fig.1](https://github.com/sergey0222/Neural-Networks-and-Value-Investing/blob/master/fig/model_1_figure.png)

As can be seen from the figure for approximately 400 companies out of 1607 (~25%) we can give pretty good prediction (error is less than 10%)
